# DataScience
This Repository groups my journey with the data science field, mainly the Machine Learning subfield. It contains collection of notebooks used in multiple competitions and training sessions prepared for new comers.

You can check more solutions and public notebooks in my Kaggle [@Sigm0oid](https://www.kaggle.com/hamzarhibi).

Kaggle Platform is a great way to get started on some data science projects/work for people of all skill levels. There are a lot of great beginner projects that you could work on, and more advanced projects as well.

I'll be keeping progress of the Kaggle projects that I do here. Hopefully it'll be of help to anyone!
